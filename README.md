# Employee List App

This project is an Employee List app built with Next.js, implementing Server-Side Rendering to fetch the initial batch of employees and handle client-side pagination for loading more employees. The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and features a responsive grid layout, animations, and dynamic employee background colors.

## Features
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): The initial batch of employees (e.g., 20) is loaded on the server and rendered for fast page load.

- Client-Side Pagination: A "Load More" button allows you to fetch additional employees dynamically on the client side.

- Dynamic Background Colors: Each employee card is assigned a random, retro-style background color.

- Responsive Design: The employee grid is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes with graceful transitions.

- Spinner for Loading: A loading spinner is displayed when fetching more employees.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js: For server-side rendering and dynamic routing.

- Tailwind CSS: For easy, responsive styling and modern UI components.

- JavaScript: Core language for implementing logic.
